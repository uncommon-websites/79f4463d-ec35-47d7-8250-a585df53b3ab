    "description": "The image is a screenshot of the homepage of the University of Nizwa's website. The top section features the University of Nizwa’s logo on the left side, which includes text in Arabic and English. The navigation bar at the top offers links to various users and sections: Students, Alumni, Staff, Visitors, Prospective Students, About Unizwa, Academic Affairs, Research, Resources and Services, and Ishraqaa. On the right side, there is a globe icon (possibly for language selection), a magnifying glass icon (search), a calendar icon, and a prominent “Apply Now” button.\n\nThe main central section of the homepage features an inspirational message in large white text: \"Discover Your Future, Shape Your Legacy.\" Below that, a smaller text states: \"Join a community of innovators, thinkers, and leaders. Experience education that goes beyond traditional boundaries.\"\n\nUnderneath this tagline, three key statistics are highlighted:\n- 11K+ Students\n- 100+ Programs\n- 60% Employment Rate\n\nBelow these stats, there are three interactive elements: an \"Explore Programs\" button, a quick search bar, and another \"Apply Now\" button.\n\nThe background image shows a night or dusk view of a landscape with mountainous terrain and city lights, slightly blurred to emphasize the text in the foreground."
